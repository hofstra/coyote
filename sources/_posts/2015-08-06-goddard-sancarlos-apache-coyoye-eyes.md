Coyote's Eyes

Rabbits were throwing their eyes up. Coyote ran there and said, "Cousin let me do it too." They refused, but Coyote repeated his request. The rabbits helped Coyote get his eyes out and he threw them up. They fell back again and he repeated the process. Then the rabbit said, "Let his eyes hang on the tree." The next time Coyote threw his eyes up they caught and hung in the tree. Coyote had no eyes and Rabbit made eyes for him of pitch.
