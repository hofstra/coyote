Gill surveys the role of the coyote acorss time: in the Pleistocene, among Southern California Indians, during and after the Spanish conquest, among American settler-colonialists, and in urban settings. Gill quotes extensively from primary soruces and, as indicated in the title, focuses most of his attention on the Los Angeles Basin.
