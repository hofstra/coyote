U. S. RANGER IS CHAMPION COYOTE KILLER

Uncle Sam's forest rangers who patrol (the great western reserves and protect them from fire voluntarily hunt down wild animals that prey upon sheep, which graze by the thousands within the forest reserves during the open seasons. The coyote, first cousin of the wolf, is the most numerous and pernicious of the lot. Coyotes attack a flock and, for the fiendish love of killing, slay helpless sheep right and left. Because of their great speed, cunning, and keen ears, they are hard to catch. Jack McEntire, ranger in the Malheur forest reserve in Oregon, holds the record for killing coyotes. During last year he shot more than 100, thereby saving three- or four times that many sheep.
