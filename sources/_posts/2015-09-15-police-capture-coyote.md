The calls started coming in before sunrise on Saturday: Coyote spotted in Battery Park City.

Already on alert after several days of coyote sightings, police officers from the First Precinct, backed by specially trained members of the Police Department’s Emergency Services Unit, converged on a spot along the Hudson River near 1 World Trade Center just as the sun was rising, officials said.
