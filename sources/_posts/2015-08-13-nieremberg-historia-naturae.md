The Indians call one kind of fox “Coyotl” (coyote). It is an animal unknown in the Old World, with a wolf-like head, big, bright, pale eyes, small, pointed ears and a dark, long snout. Its claws are thick and curved, and its tail long and thick. It resembles our foxes (to whom it may be related), and is about half-way between a wolf and a fox in size. It hunts pigs and deer, and has been known to kill humans. Its coat is long and dappled. It is a wily hunter. If another animal snatches its prey, it can recognize the thief days later and hunts it down.  It is found in many parts of New Spain, especially in colder climates.
