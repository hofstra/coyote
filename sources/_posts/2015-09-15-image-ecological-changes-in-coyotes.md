This slide shows changes in the coyote's mandible over time. Meachen et al.'s study examines samples from three distinct populations: Pleistocene, Holocene (Pit 10), and Modern. Their findings indicate that the coyote was able to adapt to environmental changes by shifting its dietary habits. The Pleistocene coyote mandibles are best suited for hunting large prey; the smaller mandibles of the Holocene and Modern coyotes indicate a shift toward smaller prey and ominvory. It is likely that this adaptation allowed *Canis latrans* to survive while other mammals went extinct in the late Pleistocene.
